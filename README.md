#  Hey there, I'm Nahomy 

### üåê Aspiring Cloud Infrastructure Engineer | ‚öôÔ∏è GNS3 Lab Builder | üîÄ Routing Enthusiast

I'm currently focused on mastering **enterprise routing**, **cloud infrastructure design**, and **network automation**. With a foundation in traditional networking and cybersecurity, I bring a strong understanding of IP architecture, routing behavior, and layered troubleshooting ‚Äî all essential for building modern, scalable cloud environments.

---

##  Current Focus

-  Learning dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, BGP)
-  Practicing Layer 3 troubleshooting in GNS3 and cloud labs
-  Exploring hybrid cloud networking concepts
-  Preparing for certifications in cloud, SD-WAN, and security

##  Repositories

A snapshot of my hands-on projects and study efforts across networking, security, and infrastructure design:

|  Repository |  Focus Area |
|---------------|---------------|
| [`Networking-labs`](https://github.com/nahomyOvanna/Networking-labs) | Routing, troubleshooting, and scalable cloud-ready infrastructure labs using GNS3 and VyOS |
| [`Cybersecurity-playground`](https://github.com/nahomyOvanna/Cybersecurity-playground/tree/main) | Security-focused labs exploring attack & defense, firewall rules, Nmap scanning, and traffic analysis |
| [`Study-notes`](https://github.com/nahomyOvanna/Study-notes) | Deep-dive notes on networking, cloud, and security ‚Äî written for clarity, retention, and certification prep |

Each repo is part of my journey to become a confident cloud infrastructure engineer with strong networking and security fundamentals.

##  About Me

I transitioned into tech with a mission to understand how cloud and network infrastructure shape our connected world. I learn by doing ‚Äî building labs, breaking things, and fixing them again ‚Äî and I document it all here to solidify my skills and help others on a similar path.

I‚Äôm passionate about cloud networking because it combines my love of architecture, security, and systems thinking. Whether configuring OSPF in GNS3 or planning for BGP-based redundancy in the cloud, I‚Äôm driven by the challenge of designing systems that are resilient, scalable, and efficient.
