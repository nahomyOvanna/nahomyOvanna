# 👋 Hey there, I'm Nahomy

### 🌐 Cloud Networking Enthusiast | ⚙️ Aspiring Infrastructure Engineer | 🔐 Security-Aware Technologist

Welcome to my GitHub! This space is part portfolio, part digital journal — where I build, break, fix, learn and document my hands-on journey into **cloud networking** — from traditional L3 routing labs in GNS3 to designing scalable, resilient network architectures in the cloud.

I'm currently focused on mastering **enterprise networking**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **dynamic routing technologies**. With a background in networking and **cybersecurity fundamentals**, I approach cloud with a deep understanding of **IP addressing**, **routing logic**, and **protocol behaviors** —all essential skills for a cloud infrastructure engineer.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- 🧠 Learning dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, BGP)
- 🛠️ Practicing Layer 3 troubleshooting in GNS3 and cloud labs
- ☁️ Exploring hybrid cloud networking concepts
- 📚 Preparing for certifications in cloud, SD-WAN, and security
