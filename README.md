# 👋 Hey there, I'm Nahomy Ovanna

### 🌐 Aspiring Cloud Infrastructure Engineer | ⚙️ GNS3 Lab Builder | 🔀 Routing Enthusiast

I'm currently focused on mastering **enterprise routing**, **cloud infrastructure design**, and **network automation**. With a foundation in traditional networking and cybersecurity, I bring a strong understanding of IP architecture, routing behavior, and layered troubleshooting — all essential for building modern, scalable cloud environments.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- 🧠 Learning dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, BGP)
- 🛠️ Practicing Layer 3 troubleshooting in GNS3 and cloud labs
- ☁️ Exploring hybrid cloud networking concepts
- 📚 Preparing for certifications in cloud, SD-WAN, and security

## 🌱 About Me

I transitioned into tech with a mission to understand how cloud and network infrastructure shape our connected world. I learn by doing — building labs, breaking things, and fixing them again — and I document it all here to solidify my skills and help others on a similar path.

I’m passionate about cloud networking because it combines my love of architecture, security, and systems thinking. Whether configuring OSPF in GNS3 or planning for BGP-based redundancy in the cloud, I’m driven by the challenge of designing systems that are resilient, scalable, and efficient.
